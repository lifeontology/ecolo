EcoLO: The Escherichia coli Life Ontology

EcoLO was initially developed to represent the E. coli lacZ regulation model.

EcoLO is developed by extending the Life Ontology (LifO), a general purpose species-neural upper level ontology of life. Like LifO, the EcoLO developed is based on the OneNet Theory of Life: http://www.hegroup.org/onenettheory.html.
